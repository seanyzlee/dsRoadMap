# dsRoadMap
Roadmap documenting my journey for a career in data science and ML  
  
Note for self: essentially, think of data science as the top of the iceberg. Once you learn data science fundamentals, you may start to branch off and specialize. For example, after getting some experience in data science, you may look into AI/ML (mid of the iceberg), and then deep learning (bottom of the iceberg). In no way is this comparison 100% accurate, but it's just here to paint an illustration.  
  
Read First  
[Python for Data Science](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)  
  
This also teaches data science (theory and app.) knowledge  
  
Do in order  
[Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/101kKHaK557_4HjYj0DjNaVLU0YkqNg3T/view?usp=sharing)  
[Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](http://14.139.161.31/OddSem-0822-1122/Hands-On_Machine_Learning_with_Scikit-Learn-Keras-and-TensorFlow-2nd-Edition-Aurelien-Geron.pdf) - Aurelien Geron  
[Deep Learning with Python, Third Edition](https://sourestdeeds.github.io/pdf/Deep%20Learning%20with%20Python.pdf) - François Chollet and Matthew Watson  
WARNING: THEORY HEAVY, HEAD WILL HURT [Understanding Deep Learning](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/)  

When time allows, learn how to visualize and plot these graphs in Python and R:  
[The Functional Art: An Introduction to Information Graphics and Visualization](https://paul.zhdk.ch/pluginfile.php/93337/mod_resource/content/1/The%20Functional%20Art%20-%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Information%20Graphics%20and%20Visualization%20by%20Alberto%20Cairo%20%28z-lib.org%29.pdf)  
  
Additional Resources/Reference Books  
[Data Science Road Map](https://i.am.ai/roadmap/#fundamentals)  
[Data Science in R](https://datasciencebook.ca/)  
[If Waterloo didn't teach stats concept well enough](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkStats/)
